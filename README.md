## Overview
This is a simple car price prediction trained on random forest regressor. Saved model (car_model.pkl) take year, showroom price, km driven, no of owner, fuel type, transmission type and dealer/individual as input and predict output as current price expected. 
## Motivation
I spend my most of the time in solving kaggle competitions, trying to improve accuracy of models. But I am not gettting confidence in this domain then in live streaming of Krish Naik sir he said try to build complete end-to-end project.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into three part:
1. Training a machine learning model using random forest regressor. (car_price_prediction.py)
2. Building a Flask web app.
3. Hosting app on Heroku.
